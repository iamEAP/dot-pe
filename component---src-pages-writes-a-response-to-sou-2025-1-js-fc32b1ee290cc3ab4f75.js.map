If\n            put into force, these requirements will have an immediate and\n            detrimental effect on Sweden's ability to attract and retain highly\n            skilled labor, of which there is an ongoing shortage. We in\n            particular oppose the extended residency requirement, additional\n            knowledge requirements, as well as the introduction of a\n            self-sufficiency requirement.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In the event the proposal is to move forward, we concur with the\n            recommendation that transitional provisions be put in place for\n            citizenship applications received before the law goes into force. We\n            however recommend an alternative formulation of those transitional\n            rules.\n          </p>\n          <h2>\n            Length of residence for acquisition of Swedish citizenship (section\n            7.4.3)\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            To be a labor migrant anywhere is to live a life of uncertainty.\n            Putting down roots in a country where your right to work and reside\n            is conditional on factors outside of your control (e.g. company\n            restructuring, market conditions, or changes to laws) carries high\n            financial and personal risk. Citizenship is the only way to\n            unconditionally retain the right of residency and work and to\n            eliminate that risk.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Sweden's current residency requirement for citizenship (5 years in\n            the normal case) is among the lowest in the world and therefore an\n            invaluable differentiator in the competition for skilled foreign\n            labor. All other things being equal, a faster path to citizenship,\n            and therefore stability, would be the deciding factor in where a\n            worker chooses to move.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Any increase to the residency length would therefore harm Sweden's\n            attractiveness on the global labor market. The proposed 8 year\n            residency length, which would bring Sweden in line with many of its\n            peers, would erase that advantage entirely. Anything above 8 years\n            (which would approach a quarter of a working life) would be\n            devastating to Sweden's attractiveness.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The length of residence required to obtain Swedish citizenship\n            should therefore not be increased beyond 5 years.\n          </p>\n          <h2>\n            Demonstrating knowledge of Swedish and Swedish society (section\n            9.2.2)\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            Being an immigrant is a high-stress endeavor: navigating new\n            bureaucracies, leaving behind family and friends, and adjusting to a\n            new environment all take their toll. Attaching language and\n            knowledge requirements to key administrative milestones in an\n            immigrant's journey only adds to that stress.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Sweden is exceptional in that no language or other knowledge\n            requirements are currently in place for permanent residency or\n            citizenship. This is a rare benefit for prospective workers and\n            therefore a strong differentiator in Sweden's attractiveness to\n            foreign skilled labor. This is especially the case given the reality\n            that the majority of the roles we fill are performed in English.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            We moved to Sweden to pursue full-time work; fitting in language and\n            other knowledge acquisition between work and family time can be\n            challenging. While some language and knowledge skills may ultimately\n            prove useful for integration in the long term, the ability to pursue\n            that knowledge at one's own pace and according to one's own needs\n            and abilities is an undeniable benefit, especially when compared to\n            peer countries.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Additional language and knowledge requirements should therefore not\n            be added.\n          </p>\n          <h2>\n            The requirement that foreigners can support themselves (section\n            10.4.2)\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            Immigrating to a country is one of the largest changes one can make\n            in one's life. In making that decision, many of us needed to take\n            into consideration our partners' and/or our family's lives.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Partners of skilled labor migrants have traditionally found it\n            challenging to break into the Swedish labor market, especially when\n            their careers are outside the tech sector. While the proposed\n            introduction of a self-sufficiency requirement at the reserve amount\n            (förbehållsbelopp) would not directly impact us as individuals, a\n            higher income requirement could affect our families.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When evaluating countries to immigrate to, the ability for all\n            members of our families to follow the path to citizenship together\n            cannot be underestimated as a benefit. Any possibility for our\n            family members' rights to differ from ours over time will introduce\n            friction into the process of attracting foreign labor. At the very\n            least, it would significantly bias the types of individuals who\n            would be willing to move here.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            While we believe the amount proposed for self-sufficiency is\n            reasonable, we must nonetheless oppose its introduction, especially\n            if any higher amount is considered.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Transitional provisions (section 17.2)</h2>\n          <p>\n            A significant contributor in the success of Sweden as a society is\n            the consistently high trust placed in its institutions. Given the\n            proposal aims to alter legal conditions which materially formed the\n            basis for our decision to move to Sweden, doing so retroactively\n            would substantially harm our relationship with the state. We\n            therefore concur with the need to have transitional provisions in\n            place if the proposal is to go into force.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            At a minimum, those transitional provisions should reflect what has\n            been proposed: that applications sent in prior to the law going into\n            effect should be evaluated under the rules in place at the time of\n            application.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An even higher degree of trust would be maintained if citizenship\n            applications would instead be evaluated based on the rules which\n            were in force at the beginning of legal Swedish residency.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>\n          <p>\n            Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on this proposal.\n            This referral response is hereby signed by the following labor\n            migrants employed within the tech sector in Sweden.
