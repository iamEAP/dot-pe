In one sense, I haven’t been impacted at\nall by everything going on in the world: I will end the year just as I began\nit, developing software in front of a computer screen from home.</p>\n<p>In another sense, 2020 was the peak of a multi-year run-up in anxiety and\nmental fatigue for me. How little my good fortune has changed compared with the\nunimaginably many misfortunes around me became an unignorable cognitive\ndissonance. I spent a lot of energy worrying about systemic problems I struggle\nto see solutions to.</p>\n<p>I believe my ideal social contract would be something like this: I want to be\nfree to focus my energy on my work, relationships, and interests. For this\nfreedom, I’d gladly contribute to a state that administers programs that reduce\nthe need for individuals like me to have to focus their energy on anything else.</p>\n<p>In practice, this is stuff like equal access to healthcare, education,\nchildcare, welfare, and time-off: things that in the US are not a given and end\nup distributed unevenly.</p>\n<p>So I find myself here, a guest of Sweden, which at least at first glance seems\nto operate under such a social contract. I’ve enjoyed learning the language,\nthe culture, and look forward to a little more of a hands-on approach to it all\nin the coming year or so, pandemic permitting.</p>\n<p>While uprooting your life and moving halfway around the world is not possible\nfor everyone, I hope that those also suffering from the mental fog of the last\nyear and beyond find time to reflect on why, and find a better allocation of\nenergy in the coming year.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Goodbye Seattle","date":"December 31, 2020","description":"Hello
