For those not already aware, some personal news: I’ve moved to Stockholm,
Sweden.

Given the new year, I wanted to briefly reflect on how I ended up here. 2020
has been a trying year for everyone. In one sense, I haven’t been impacted at
all by everything going on in the world: I will end the year just as I began
it, developing software in front of a computer screen from home.

In another sense, 2020 was the peak of a multi-year run-up in anxiety and
mental fatigue for me. How little my good fortune has changed compared with the
unimaginably many misfortunes around me became an unignorable cognitive
dissonance. I spent a lot of energy worrying about systemic problems I struggle
to see solutions to.

I believe my ideal social contract would be something like this: I want to be
free to focus my energy on my work, relationships, and interests. For this
freedom, I’d gladly contribute to a state that administers programs that reduce
the need for individuals like me to have to focus their energy on anything else.

In practice, this is stuff like equal access to healthcare, education,
childcare, welfare, and time-off: things that in the US are not a given and end
up distributed unevenly.

So I find myself here, a guest of Sweden, which at least at first glance seems
to operate under such a social contract. I’ve enjoyed learning the language,
the culture, and look forward to a little more of a hands-on approach to it all
in the coming year or so, pandemic permitting.

While uprooting your life and moving halfway around the world is not possible
for everyone, I hope that those also suffering from the mental fog of the last
year and beyond find time to reflect on why, and find a better allocation of
energy in the coming year.
