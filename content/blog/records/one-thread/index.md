Originally planned as a series of singles, the first (dubbed [Polaroid in Reverse](../polaroid-in-reverse/)) was released in 2010 as a limited edition of 7" lathe-cut records. Roger, Roll co-headlined the release show with future collaborator Corey Teruya's [Hello Kavita](https://open.spotify.com/album/6ZYUnUgu80KQ8GlrEVaij6), and was opened by future household names [The Lumineers](https://open.spotify.com/album/2MTEiVNgRgIvVIrJAqHNBu).

Now 15 years later, from the hushed beauty of Sweden's forests, and featuring Teruya and James Han ([Landlines](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6GDiB0aIxZqPwgDpysxbIE?si=0M3nvvPrRA28m0F95EJpuw), [Nathaniel Rateliff & The Wheel](https://open.spotify.com/album/5sMF0P8JErrHQISyKFqfOs?si=otqCuCNwRv-w0f7fa-biWA)), One Thread finally sees the light of day--the 5-song EP emphatically closing the door on Roger, Roll's first two decades, opening up for more music to come.

> One Thread's reflective songs are a blend of a type of Americana tonally illuminated with incandescent keyboard melodies, spare rhythm guitar and Peterson's expressive and commanding vocals. Peterson spent many of the intervening years abroad and these tracks feel like he's reconnected with a neglected part of himself, giving voice to that specific range of emotions experienced after taking stock of one's life and rediscovering a part of your psyche that tenderly needs nurturing now.
