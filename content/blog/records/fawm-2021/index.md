A successful attempt to write and record 14 songs in 28 days as part of
[February Album Writing Month](https://www.fawm.org), and a pleasantly
surprising success at that, given it has been over a decade since I've written
new music (and I recently [made a big move](../../moves-to/sweden-2020) rooted
in finding the energy to do so again).

Given the quantity-over-quality nature of the challenge, the songs ended up
spanning genres (bossa nova, surf-rock, and everything in between), though
revolved around the same instrumentation (classical guitar, piano, drums, and
vocals).
